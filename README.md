CS300 Homework 1


This first one contains several errors just starting off that are very basic. 


line 20 password needs to be pass
line 24 password needs to be pass
line 24 ";" is missing at the end of the line

gets function is warned against due to not checking and can cause buffer overflow

strcmp can also cause buffer overflows
